# Question

You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present at the party, if yes, (s)he doesnâ€™t know anyone at the party. Your task is to find the celebrity at the party in Time Complexity O(n) 

Mean: Celebrity is aperson who is know to everyone but celebrtiy doesn't know anyone

# Solution

if matric is 4*4 
wher cell on row X and column Y marked 1, mean X knows Y
and marked 0 , mean X doesn't know Y

So starting from last coumne as Y=4 and X=0
 if this cell is 0 means X doesn't know Y, that also implies Y can't be celebrity hence decrease Y by 1
 if the cell was 1 means X knows Y, that means X can't be celebrity but Y can be or cannot be

 We continue this process untill X is less than Y
 whatever value is left of X we check if all the value in that column is 0 if yes then X is celebrity
 else return -1

This contains use cases, where array is rotated, and we need to find tha given number

#Problem:
We rotate an ascending order sorted array at some point unknown to user. So for instance, 3 4 5 6 7 might become 5 6 7 3 4.
Modify binary search algorithm to find an element in the rotated array in O(log n) time and O(1) Space complexity

#Answer:
Read comments in code.
